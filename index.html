          <h3>Make an Impact</h3>
          <p>FUP is all about getting up-close and personal with Boston and Cambridge through community service. The program is run by MIT's Public Service Center, which organizes volunteer programs, sponsors work-studies, and provides other opportunities for service at MIT. There's no better way to get to know the city than by working side-by-side with the people who live there to make it a better place. </p>
          <p>Places we've volunteered in the past include the Greater Boston Food Bank, the New England Aquarium, Cambridgeport Children's Center, Emerald Necklace Conservancy parks, the American Diabetes Association, and many, many others. Everyone has a unique service schedule, so you'll be with different FUPpers and counselors at a variety of placements through the week. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="span3">
          <h3>Enter MIT</h3>
          <p>
          Scattered through the week are cool activities to keep you on your toes. Some might help you explore the city, while some will help you prepare yourself for this next chapter of your life called college. And don't worry - we'll find some time to sleep in there.</p>
          <p>Each evening there will be time to unwind and reflect. We'll discuss our service placements and the role we play in the greater Boston community. This is a great time to get to know an even smaller group of fellow 2015's who you'll meet with each night, as well as your pair of small-group counselors. This is also a great time to ask your counselors what MIT's really like!

       <div class="span6">
          <h3>Explore Boston</h3>
          <p>The MIT lifestyle "work hard, play hard" is alive and well during FUP. After a full day of service, FUP continues to explore the city and what it has to offer after dark. We've made trips to the best dessert places in town for a late-night snack. We've gone bowling near Fenway Park. We've scoped out Boston culture at comedy and jazz clubs. We've gone to some of the coolest restaurants in Boston and Cambridge. We've sang our hearts out at karaoke downtown. And we'll make sure this year is more fun than ever.</p>
          <p>An average day looks something like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We're up bright and early for a big group breakfast and wake-up.</li>
            <li>After everyone's full and energized, we'll split up into our assigned placement groups. As previously mentioned, we try to mix everyone up through the week so we get to know the whole group and get to try different kinds of service placements. You'll then head out with your counselor leaders to your service placements for the day.</li>
            <li>Each evening looks different, but there will be some sort of activity and some sort of (delicious) dinner.</li>
            <li>We'll meet in small groups for reflection and discussion, reinforcing the lessons learned from the day.</li>
            <li>Finally, we'll head out into Boston for some late-night fun. The group will return from our activity in time for bed, and we'll start again the next morning.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The days are fun, but they're jam-packed. FUP is an all-day and all-week commitment, but it's not one you'll regret.</p>
