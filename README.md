fup_site
========

MIT's Freshman Urban Program website.

Setup instructions:

1) First, you need to be added to the "mitfup-www" Moira list. Right now, David Ku (davidlaiku@gmail.com) is the owner of the list. Email him with your athena username to be added to it.
2) SSH into your athena account, and attach the mitfup locker (type "attach mitfup"). Then, you can "cd /mit/mitfup", which will take you into the fup directory. The web_scripts/ directory in this folder contains what will be live at fup.mit.edu.

To make major changes:
-Make changes within the repository located at https://github.com/maxko87/fup_site. Email maxko87@gmail.com to be added as an owner of the repository. Then you can clone the repository locally, make any changes you want, push to the github repo, and then pull from the web_scripts/ directory listed above.

To make minor changes:
-Feel free to just make the changes directly in the web_scripts/ folder. Note that these won't reflect in the github repository itself, and should ideally should be pushed to the github repository at some point in the future to maintain a consistent state. 

If you have any questions, email maxko87@gmail.com
